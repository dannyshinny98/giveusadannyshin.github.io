                                Many antibiotics cause stomach upset or other gastrointestinal side effects. These can include:

nausea,
vomiting,
cramps,
diarrhea.
Macrolide antibiotics, cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones may cause more stomach upset than other antibiotics.

What to do:

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can take your antibiotic with food. Eating can help reduce stomach side effects from certain antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline (Doryx).

However, this approach won’t work for all antibiotics. Some antibiotics, such as tetracycline, have to be taken on an empty stomach.

Talk to your doctor to make sure you know how you’re supposed to take your drug and if there are other ways you can ease stomach side effects.

When to call your doctor:

Mild diarrhea usually clears up after you stop taking the drug. However, if the diarrhea is severe, it may cause:

abdominal pain and cramping,
fever,
nausea,
mucus or blood in your stool.
These symptoms can be caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in your intestines. In these cases, call your doctor right away.

On Oct. 16, the South Korean Embassy in Canada said on Twitter: “Even if South Koreans are in a region where marijuana is legal, it will be illegal for them to consume it. Please take care not to commit an illegal act and be punished.”

                                Codeine cough medicine can kill you, via respiratory failure. Your lungs will be as sedated as your mind, and they’ll stop pumping. If you have a nonfatal overdose, you may just get very sick for a bit, vomit, or remain unconscious for a while.

Cough medicine containing dextromethorphan is less fatal. upwards of 2500 mg can be taken before risking death, and a very strong trip arises at 600–800. Any given bottle of DXM-containing cough syrup will likely have a max of 500–800mg in it.

An overdose on this will mostly have you tripping out for a day (a couple days if it’s DXM polisterix, found in Delsym). This is a dissociative psychedelic, and has a very heavy body load. It will be an intense experience, but more than likely non-fatal, nor permanently damaging.

                                Krokodil is Russia’s secret addiction. It is believed that over one million Russians are addicted to the drug. 

Users of krokodil are attracted to the drug due to its low price; it is sold at £20 a gram while heroin is sold for £60. However, krokodil is considered more dangerous than heroin because it is often homemade, with ingredients including painkillers, iodine, lighter fluid and industrial cleaning agents. This chemical make-up makes the drug highly dangerous and likely to cause gangrene, and eventually rotting of the flesh.

                               Marijuana is one of the most popular recreational drugs worldwide, and is the #1 illegal drug in the US (followed by cocaine). As medical marijuana has become legal in many countries as well as about half of the states in the USA, it is now possible to discuss its use for treatment of common conditions such as dizziness, nausea and headache.

Cannabis is a generic term used for drugs produced from plants belong to the genus Cannabis (i.e. marijuana). Cannabis is not a single substance but rather is a mixture of up to roughly 60 compounds. Some of them, like THC (d-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), are psychoactive, and most others are not.

                                Cocaine is a powerfully addictive stimulant drug made from the leaves of the coca plant native to South America. Although health care providers can use it for valid medical purposes, such as local anesthesia for some surgeries, recreational cocaine use is illegal. As a street drug, cocaine looks like a fine, white, crystal powder. Street dealers often mix it with things like cornstarch, talcum powder, or flour to increase profits. They may also mix it with other drugs such as the stimulant amphetamine, or synthetic opioids, including fentanyl. Adding synthetic opioids to cocaine is especially risky when people using cocaine don’t realize it contains this dangerous additive. Increasing numbers of overdose deaths among cocaine users might be related to this tampered cocaine.

                               Methamphetamine, most commonly known as “meth,” “crystal,” “speed,” and “ice,” is an addictive stimulant that causes users to experience an intense euphoric rush 1. Meth can be smoked, snorted, injected, or consumed orally by users.

Meth is the second most popular illegal drug in the world 2. In 2014, almost 13 million Americans over the age of 12 reported having used meth at some point in their lifetimes 3.

Over time, repeated meth use can lead to the development of physical dependence and tolerance. As tolerance builds, meth users will often need to continually increase their usual dose to achieve the desired high. This is extremely dangerous because when a user consumes too much meth, he can experience an overdose.

In 2011 there were over 102,000 meth-involved emergency room visits in the United States alone 4. More than half of these visits involved a combination of meth and other drugs, with the most commonly co-abused substances being marijuana and alcohol.

Being aware of the signs and symptoms of a meth overdose is essential, as the sooner that a person experiencing an overdose receives help, the higher the chances of survival.

                                Even after years of heavy use, marijuana doesn’t seem to have much of an impact on the physical health of the body.

So finds a recent study published in JAMA Psychiatry, which analyzed data from a group of 1,037 New Zealanders followed from their birth until age 38. The researchers, led by Madeline Meier of Arizona State University, looked at whether cannabis use from age 18 to 38 was linked to several aspects of physical health, which were measured at several points throughout the years of the study through lab tests and self-reports.
