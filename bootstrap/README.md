GIVEUSA is a website created to inform teenagers and adults about the dangers and risks of drugs. Our website only deals with illegal drugs, not medicine. We also provide links to very professional websites where you can learn more about drugs. GIVEUSA let's you know about global news, US news, and South Korea news, for you to stay on top of what's going on in the world regarding use of illegal drugs. As an educator you want to help youth stay clear of drugs and you know you need to reach them before the dealers do. While time and resources for effective drug education are sometimes lacking, and the materials used are often outdated, not to mention that they donâ€™t factually speak to the kids, we can help. Through a worldwide network of volunteers, 50 million of drug prevention booklets have been distributed, tens of thousands of drug awareness events have been held in some 180 countries and Truth About Drugs public service announcements have been aired on more than 500 television stations. These materials and activities have helped people around the world learn about the destructive side effects of drugs and thereby make the decision for themselves to not use them. ALthough our website may not have much power of influence among people around the world, we want our website to help atleast one person, because a single life is as important as many. 

To provide a professional look to our visitors to ensure that we are not some type of scammers, we kept our theme in a very monochromatic color scheme. We didn't want our site to look colorful because that would make the overall feel of the website quite childish. By using blue, black and white, our website was able to look very trustworthy.
