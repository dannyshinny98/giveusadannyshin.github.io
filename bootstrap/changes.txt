Homework 1 [beginning of semester ~ HW1]
   As a team, we decided our team name to be GIVE-USA and we meant this name to promote not only the excellence of the quality and work ethics of our team, but also awareness towards drug abuse. Because we recognized a big problem in the current society with drug abuse, we decided that creating a page that informs people about the dangers of drugs and how we can overcome the problem would be very beneficial. Therefore, we created a overall look and feel of a very positive webpage on A4 sheets of paper. We placed our page names, logo, navigation bar, and content area very neatly on those pieces of paper, and colored them very colorfully. 
    
    
    
Homework 2 [HW1 ~ HW2]

    We started from scratch to create our website in the way we exactly wanted. We created a beautiful navgation bar at the top of the page, which followed your scroll as you scroll 
    downwards, and this is called sticky navbar. We created a very basic, simple, and easy to use layout for our visitors. The website mainly used pictures and text for the readers convenience. Basically, the overall look and feel of the website was founded at this point. We made a log-in and sign-up page which connected you to facebook, twitter, and google.com for easier process. However, due to our lack of knowledge at this point, we were only able to link the user to the websites, and was not able to store any information, meaning that you couldnt actually login nor sign up. Because we faced a lot of troubles structuring the website, we face difficulties along the way. It took very long time for us to settle down on the overall color theme and fixing the html and css coding problems, but we were able to complete the assignment with no problem in time. 
  
    
    
    
Homework 3 [HW2 ~ HW3]
    At this point we realized that our knowledge to code the whole website with complex html, CSS , and javascript was not sufficient enough. Therefore, we downloaded a very reliable template with sufficient amount of webpages. Then, we added in pictures and texts to set the overall structure again. We designated what types of drugs we were going to research and display on our website in the "Drugs" tab, and also the USA news, south korean news, and global news, which are all subpages of the "News" tab. We put divs in all of our pages to set aside space for certain texts and images. We created a contact form in our webpage so that the users can contact us about any questions they may have, it requires the users to type in their name, phone number, and their comments, etc. We also created a very good looking pricing page, which indicates the prices of the services we provide. We downloaded multiple pictures from the internet and saved it inside the bootstrap folder. We put links among the pages so the users can successfully use our website. Also we created a quick navigation page incase if the users are looking for a specific page and want to get the information faster. Then, we finalized the images and texts of the website. We put in actual data collected all over the internet. We downloaded more pictures that was appropriate for our webpages' use, and placed captions for each photo. Additionally, we placed 2 multimedia videos in the drug-information page for the users to view right on our website. We fixed all the problems that we faced with our links to external websites such as the websites we got our news information from, and also problems in image src. We tried to organize our files into separate folders but it wasnt possible. The webpages did not show any images. But after we got more information from the classes, we were able to fix the problem by placing the file name that the images were placed into, infront of the src image-location written before. We resized the images so that the images could be shown in very uniform way, we applied the same height and width according to the sections the images were placed in. Also we placed a table in the quick navigation page for easier and faster navigation throughout our website, and for a cleaner and simpler look to organize the list of webpage names.
    
    
    
Homework 4 [HW3 ~ HW4]
    We finalized the information and pictures that were going to be submitted for this webpage development. We added our own personal profile pictures in the "About" page to connect closer with our visitor. We decided to put the 3 total tables in the drug care plan to make a very visually appealing and simple interface for visitors for the pricing of the programs we provide. We fixed all image captions from "Image from Universal pictures" to the real source of the website. We've included a image resource document in word format in the "Images" folder for you to check where we go all our pictures from.
