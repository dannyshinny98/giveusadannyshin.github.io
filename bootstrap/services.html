                        <h4>ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY</h4>
                        <p>Environmentally friendly or environment-friendly, (also referred to as eco-friendly, nature-friendly, and green) are sustainability and marketing terms referring to goods and services, laws, guidelines and policies that claim reduced, minimal, or no harm upon ecosystems or the environment. Companies use these ambiguous terms to promote goods and services, sometimes with additional, more specific certifications, such as ecolabels.</p>
                        <p>The International Organization for Standardization has developed ISO 14020 and ISO 14024 to establish principles and procedures for environmental labels and declarations that certifiers and eco-labellers should follow. In particular, these standards relate to the avoidance of financial conflicts of interest, the use of sound scientific methods and accepted test procedures, and openness and transparency in the setting of standards.</p>

                        <h4>FACE-TO-FACE MEETING</h4>
                        <p>Earlier, face to face meetings were the only option when people had to communicate ideas or hold discussions with one another. However, with the progress in technology, easier methods of communications were introduced, and people could host meetings virtually using popular software like ezTalks. Undoubtedly, such tools made life a lot easier, helped save both time and money that would be invested in traveling to and from the meeting location, and thus people gladly started embracing the idea of virtual meetings. Yet, face to face meetings have not been become completely extinct, and can never will, owing to various benefits they offer. So, without further wait let us get to learn about a few face to face meeting advantages.</p>
                        <p>Communication is not necessarily conveyed through words alone, and you can understand a lot if you carefully observe the body language of a person and the small signs he/she gives through facial expressions and hand gestures. You need not be any expert to understand these signs, as you subconsciously will be able to figure them out. Email or a phone call conversation does not allow you to read these signs, but the fact is if you are able to read the body language of people it can prove to be immensely beneficial for you. You will be able to understand much more than what the person is actually telling you.</p>

                        <h4>LIFE-CHANGING</h4>
                        <p>Many people don't understand why or how other people become addicted to drugs. They may mistakenly think that those who use drugs lack moral principles or willpower and that they could stop their drug use simply by choosing to. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will. Drugs change the brain in ways that make quitting hard, even for those who want to. Fortunately, researchers know more than ever about how drugs affect the brain and have found treatments that can help people recover from drug addiction and lead productive lives.</p>
                        <p>Addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences. The initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, but repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person’s self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take drugs. These brain changes can be persistent, which is why drug addiction is considered a "relapsing" disease—people in recovery from drug use disorders are at increased risk for returning to drug use even after years of not taking the drug.</p>

                        <h4>WELL-EXPERIENCED (BIG DATA)</h4>
                        <p>Big data analytics could be described as high-velocity, high-volume and/or high-variety information that need new kinds of processing to enable improved decision making, process optimization and insight discovery. Today, there are just so many machines and devices that enable people to seek and obtain information in a way that people have grown accustomed to. It resulted to a mountain of data bytes. The data analytics phenomenon has given rise to several technology trends, such as how software development firms build solutions and applications.</p>
                        <p>Software companies develop solutions that give any business organization an edge over the competition. With the explosion of Big Data, developing software solutions have been made simpler and more effective. Last year was a landmark for big data, with more organizations that store, process and extract value from all forms and sizes of data. This year, systems which support big volumes of structured and unstructured data would continue to grow. The market demands platforms that help data custodians secure and govern data analytics while empower the end users to analyze data. The systems would mature to operate well inside the enterprise IT standards and systems.</p>
